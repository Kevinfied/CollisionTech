Hello, I'm Noah (he/him). I enjoy doing competitive programming and main c++ bc why not. I enjoy taking walks, sleeping, watching movies, and learning about new things in the STEM field. Super excited for MH this year.

Hi! My name is Kevin Xu. I have a love-hate relationship with competitive programming. My main languages are Python and C++ (because I suck at all the others). Looking forward to MasseyHacks this year!

My name is Kevin Lu. I am a grade 10 student from Vincent Massey Secondary School who lives in Windsor, Ontario. I am very infamously Australian as well. Obviously, I am very excited to be participating my first MH, although I can only participate virtually. 
Hopefully you can read my introduction!
I am happy to design some physical components of my wonderful team's hack on AutoCAD, and I hope they can implement it successfully tomorrow. Many of the skills that are useful in MH were acquired by is through participation in FRC team 4903. In my free time, I enjoy being challenged to do DMOJ questions by my friends. I often struggle with them for days or even weeks. Some recent problems that I have finished are Mouse Journey and Grade 9 math. Chess is also an activity that I enjoy. I would play chess online when I have time and I try to participate in chess club each week. I haven't really been actively learning chess recently, but that is something I hope to be continuing in the near future.
Many of us are gamers here at Massey Hacks, including me. One of my favourite games to play is Super Smash Bros Ultimate. Everyday at lunch, I would go to Mr. Ing's room and play this with my friends. We would also wake up extremely early and sleep extremely late to play this on the robotics trip. This is to the point where you would reduce people's whole personality to SSBU. 
Everyone's experiences at Massey are unique and different. Let me tell you about some of my interactions with the teachers. Every break between period 4 and period 5, I would run to Mr. Nedin's class from the French wing, even though my next class is English and I have him in period 1. I would always get banned but I always come back later! Also, my friend and I go to Mr. Banwell's history class after math most days. Let's just say that, well, we got banned.
